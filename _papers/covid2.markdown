The COVID-19 pandemic generated research interest in automated models to perform classification and segmentation from medical imaging of COVID-19 patients, However, applications in real-world scenarios are still needed. We describe the development and deployment of COVID-19 decision support and segmentation system. A partnership with a Brazilian radiologist consortium, gave us access to 1000s of labeled computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images from São Paulo Hospitals. The system used EfficientNet and EfficientDet networks, state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for natural images classification and segmentation, in a real-time scalable scenario in communication with a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Additionally, the system could reject non-related images, using header analysis and classifiers. We achieved CT and X-ray classification accuracies of 0.94 and 0.98, respectively, and Dice coefficient for lung and covid findings segmentations of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively. The median response time was 7 s for X-ray and 4 min for CT.
